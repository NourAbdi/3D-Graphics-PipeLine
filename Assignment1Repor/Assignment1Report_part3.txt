**1.Load a mesh and make sure that it's visible on screen. Pick an axis (i.e. x; y or z), and
rotate the model around the axis. Scale the model such that it is always visible, no matter
the rotation. Apply the rotation around that axis in increments of 45. Put screenshots
of the results in your report, and mention which axis you chose.(bethoven 45degrees in y axis)**
