**Assignment2/part2 : displaying a shaded model**

**1.Implement the ability to add light sources to the scene, and apply transformations to
it. Your code should support point and parallel light sources. Reason about what trans-formations
make sense for each light source. Each light source must have three RGB components,
for the ambient, diffuse and specular reactions, so 9 values in total.**
