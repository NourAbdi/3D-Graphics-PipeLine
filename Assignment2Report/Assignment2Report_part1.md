**1.Replace the DrawTriangle function you implement in Assignment 1 by a function that
fills the entire triangle. You can use any of the approaches we discussed in class. Place
a model in the scene and place it such that it is clearly visible. Pick a random color for
every triangle and place a screenshot of the result in your report. This picture is usually
refered to as the color buffer. Note that you will see triangles overlapping; triangles in
the back might be occluding triangles in the front.**

**2.Implement the z-buffer algorithm. The issue mentioned above should not occur anymore.
The z-buffer can be visualized as a grey scale image (as in the lecture). Show side-by-side
pictures of the color buffer and z-buffer, for several models or viewpoints.**
